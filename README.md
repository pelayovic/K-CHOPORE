## üìñ Getting Started
To get started with **K-CHOPORE**, you'll need to meet a few prerequisites and follow the installation steps below. The pipeline is designed to be **modular** and **flexible**, allowing you to analyze **RNA-seq data** from plants or any other organisms, performing everything from **basecalling** to **epitranscriptomic modification detection**.

## üîß Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. Docker
Docker is required to run **K-CHOPORE** in a fully isolated environment. Install Docker following the instructions for your system:
- [Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/)
- [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Verify that Docker is installed:

```bash
docker --version
```
### 2. Snakemake
#### Install Snakemake for workflow management:

```bash
pip install snakemake
```
#### Check that Snakemake is installed correctly:

```bash
snakemake --version
```

### 3. Git
#### Install Git to clone the K-CHOPORE repository:


```bash
git --version
```

### 4. Python 3.8+
#### K-CHOPORE requires Python 3.8+ to run custom scripts. Ensure that the correct version of Python is installed:

```bash
python --version
```

## üî• Installation
Follow these steps to install **K-CHOPORE** and set up the necessary environment:

### Step 1: Clone the K-CHOPORE Repository
Open a terminal and clone the **K-CHOPORE** GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pelayovic/K-CHOPORE.git
cd K-CHOPORE
```
### Step 2: Build the Docker Image
Inside the cloned K-CHOPORE directory, build the Docker image:

```bash
sudo docker build -t k-chopore .
```
This process will pull in all necessary dependencies, ensuring a reproducible environment.

### Step 3: Configure the Pipeline
Edit the config.yml file located in the config/ folder to point to your input files (e.g., FAST5 files for Nanopore sequencing) and the reference genome:

```yaml
input_files:
  fast5_dir: "/workspace/data/raw/fast5"
  reference_genome: "/workspace/data/reference/genome.fasta"
output_dir: "/workspace/results"
```
## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Structure
K-CHOPORE‚Äôs structure follows a modular approach, ensuring clarity and scalability. The core components are as follows:

```bash

K-CHOPORE/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                      # Input data (FAST5, FASTQ, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ results/                   # Pipeline outputs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/                    # Configuration files for the pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/                   # Python scripts used in the pipeline
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Snakefile                  # Snakemake workflow definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile                 # Dockerfile for building the containerized environment
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                  # Project documentation
```

## üöÄ Running the Pipeline
#### Basic Command
To execute the full K-CHOPORE pipeline, run the following command. This will start with basecalling and proceed through RNA modification detection:

```bash

sudo docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/local/data:/workspace k-chopore \
    snakemake --snakefile /workspace/Snakefile --configfile /workspace/config/config.yml \
    --cores 10 --latency-wait 30 --printshellcmds
```
#### Execute a Specific Rule
If you want to run only a specific rule (e.g., basecalling or alignment), use:

```bash
sudo docker run -it --rm -v /path/to/your/local/data:/workspace k-chopore \
    snakemake --snakefile /workspace/Snakefile --cores 10 basecalling
```

## ‚öô Configuration

Configuration files are located in the config directory. Key files include:

- **config.yaml**: The main configuration file where you specify paths, parameters, and options for the analysis.
- **environment.yml**: The Conda environment configuration file with required dependencies.
- **Snakefile**: Defines the workflow rules and dependencies.

## üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Structure

The pipeline is implemented using Snakemake, which manages the workflow and dependencies. The structure includes:

- **Basecalling**: Converts raw sequencing signals to DNA/RNA sequences.
- **Normalization**: Prepares the reference genome for mapping.
- **Mapping**: Aligns reads to the reference genome.
- **Modification Detection**: Identifies epitranscriptomic modifications.
- **Isoform Analysis (optional)**: Constructs and quantifies isoforms.
- **Quality Control**: Evaluates data quality and generates metrics.
- **Multivariable Analysis**: Performs PCA and SPLS for data interpretation.

## üìä Examples and Use Cases

Explore the following use cases to see how K-CHOPORE can be applied:

- **Case Study 1**: Analysis of m6A modifications in RNA samples.
- **Case Study 2**: Isoform quantification and differential expression analysis.

Detailed examples and results are available in the results directory.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the following:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Verify paths and file names in configuration files.
- Consult the logs in the logs directory for detailed error messages.

## Limitations of K-CHOPORE
### Basecalling Bottlenecks
Basecalling using ONT‚Äôs Guppy can be a bottleneck, especially when data access from FAST5 files outpaces the processing power of the CPU/GPU. This is a potential friction point in any Nanopore workflow (Amarasinghe et al. 2020).
